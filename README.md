🚀 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, each focusing on different techniques and applications. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end workflows: from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📂 Projects Overview

1. 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
Description: A content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based on genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.
Techniques: TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, String Matching.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
Folder: Movie_Recommendation

2. 🏦 Loan Status Prediction (SVM)
Description: Predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Techniques: Data preprocessing, categorical encoding, SVM classification, accuracy evaluation.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.
Folder: Loan_Prediction

3. 🛍️ Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)
Description: Segments mall customers into groups based on Annual Income and Spending Score using K-Means clustering.
Techniques: Elbow Method, K-Means clustering, cluster visualization.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
Folder: Customer_Segmentation

4. 📚 Student Performance Prediction (Linear Regression)
Description: Predicts exam scores from the number of hours studied using Linear Regression.
Techniques: Correlation analysis, Linear Regression, regression evaluation metrics.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
Folder: Student_Score_Prediction
