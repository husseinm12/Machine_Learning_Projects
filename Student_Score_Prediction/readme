📚 Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours they studied. It demonstrates a simple supervised machine learning workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 How It Works

1.  Import Libraries
*pandas, numpy → data handling.
*matplotlib → visualization.
*scikit-learn → regression model, train/test splitting, and evaluation metrics.

2. Load & Clean Data
*Dataset: StudentPerformanceFactors.csv.
*Removes missing values and duplicate rows.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
*Scatter plot of Hours Studied vs Exam Score.
*Correlation check between variables.

4. Feature Selection
*Input feature X = Hours_Studied.
*Target variable y = Exam_Score.

5. Train/Test Split
*Splits dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

6. Model Training
*Trains a Linear Regression model on training data.
*Prints coefficient (slope) and intercept.

7. Model Evaluation
*Uses MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score for performance measurement.

8. Visualization
*Plots actual vs predicted exam scores.
*Red line shows regression fit, blue points show real test data.

🛠️ Requirements

Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Place StudentPerformanceFactors.csv in the same folder as the script.
Run the script: python Student_Score_Prediction.py
Output will include:
. Correlation between study hours and exam score.
. Regression coefficient & intercept.
. Model evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²).
. isualization comparing Actual vs Predicted scores.

📊 Example Output

Coefficient: [5.12]
Intercept: 42.3
MAE: 3.45
MSE: 18.76
RMSE: 4.33
R² Score: 0.87
